In the middle of the gun fight
In the center of the restaurant
They say, "Come with your arms raised high"
Well, they're never gonna get me
Like a bullet through a flock of doves
To wage this war against your faith in me
Your life will never be the same
On your mother's eyes, say a prayer
Say a prayer, yeah
Now, but I can't, and I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us
Well, I can't, well, I can, yeah
Too much, too late
Or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips again
------------------------
They all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost
My cellmate's a killer, they make me do push-ups in drag
But nobody cares if you're losing yourself
Am I losing myself?

Well, I miss my mom
Will they give me the chair?
Or lethal injection, or swing from a rope, if you dare?
Nobody knows all the trouble I've seen
