In the middle of the gun fight
In the center of the restaurant
They say, "Come with your arms raised high"
Well, they're never gonna get me
Like a bullet through a flock of doves
To wage this war against your faith in me
Your life will never be the same
On your mother's eyes, say a prayer
Say a prayer, yeah
-- new line
